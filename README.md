Ever wandered around the town, not knowing where public toilets are located? Worry no more, we present you our web app najdi.skret.net ("find.toilets.net"). It's an app that will find you the best toilet in the area, but that's not all – we understand that time spent on the toilet can sometimes be idle time wasted. That's why we've incorporated a captivating web game, built in Elm, to keep you entertained while you take care of business. Plus, here's the kicker: the more time you spend playing the game and utilizing our app, the greater your influence on restroom reviews becomes. Experienced "poo takers" – those who have mastered the art of efficient bathroom breaks – will have their reviews elevated, ensuring that fellow users benefit from their expertise.

Alright, let's dive into the tech specs. Our frontend is powered by Angular, giving the app its sleek appearance and smooth user experience. Meanwhile, Node.js and MongoDB Atlas handle the backend, ensuring data management and server-side functionality run smoothly.

Within MongoDB, we've set up three collections: "toilets," "users," and "comments," each serving their respective purposes in the app. "Toilets" keeps track of the restroom locations, "users" manages user data, and "comments" allows users to share their thoughts and experiences.

To keep things secure, we've implemented authentication with registration and login features, because privacy matters even in the world of toilet-finding apps.

Last but not least, we've integrated a game built in Elm to add a dash of entertainment to your restroom breaks. Because hey, why not make the most of your downtime, right?

With this tech stack in place, najdi.skret.net is primed and ready to revolutionize your bathroom adventures.
